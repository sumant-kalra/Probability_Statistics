CLEARING THE LONG STANDING DOUBTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Use visual approaches - use sets while multiplying for the total possibilities. Must use whenever multiplying.
2. Arrangements arise when two sets being multiplied have common elements & if they don't have then it forms combinations.
3. No repetition i.e, one-to-one mapping; 
    - Smaller number on top for easy calculations; Exhaustive approach; Identify the path: A->B->C.
    - If larger on the top, multiple cases for the excluding items have to be considered; Same result with both the appoaches.   
4. Repetition i.e., one-to-multiple mapping; 
    - Exhaustive appoach to identify what's at the top; Identify the path: A->B->C
5. Interesting problem: Number of ways to get 3 Heads out of 10 coin tosses; 
    * Total number of possibilities = 2^10; 10 tosses, each toss can have H or T.
    - Number of possibilities with 3H & the rest as T = arrangements of 3H and 7T = 10!/(3!.7!) 
    - Using combinations formula: equivalence to Permutations.
        :: 10 Positions numbered 1-10, the number of ways to select 3 positions out of the 10 for H = 10C3.
6. Note that selection of n items from m makes sense when n<m, because when n=m, nSelections = 1.
   For n=m, there can be only arrangements, nArrangements = n!
7. Problem of arrangements = [Selection + PermutationsOfTheSelectedItems]
8. Confusion about the repetition: Divide by the factorial of nDuplicates in the Same Set
9. Selection problems - solved not in a positional way as in permutations; Solve them in generic path forming way: A->B->C
    Definition of nCr is independent of nPr 
10. Sampling: 4x4: Order(Y/N) x Repetition(Y/N)
11. Double factorial; Interesting result: 2^n.n! = 2n!!

================================================================================================================================
Examples:
- Derive the formula of nCr from the fundamentals
- nWays to obtain 2H in a 10 coin toss?
- P(sum of 21 in 4 fair dice throw); P(sum of 22 in 4 fair dice throw); Compare? Why?
- Probability: (a) full house (b) two pairs, in poker 5 card hand? (c) Flush (ignore royal flush)  #Tip: follow from the basics how order arises
    Full house: 3 cards of same rank + 2 cards of different same rank; example 77733 
    Two pairs: 2 pairs of cards different ranks + 1 card of totally different rank; example 7733A 
    Flush: All cards from the same suite; Royal flush: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 
- Solve & interpolate with coin toss problem:
    - How many paths are there from the point (0, 0) to the point (110, 111) in the plane such that each step either consists of going one unit up or one unit to the right?
    - How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (210, 211), where each step consists of going one unit up or one unit to the right, and the path has to go through (110, 111)?
- A norepeatword is a sequence of at least one (and possibly all) of the usual 26 letters a,b,c,. . . ,z, with repetitions not allowed. For example, “course” is a norepeatword, 
    but “statistics” is not. Order matters, e.g., “course” is not the same as “source”.
    A norepeatword is chosen randomly, with all norepeatwords equally likely. 
    Show that the probability that it uses all 26 letters is very close to 1/e.
- Grouping vs Selection:
	nWays(select 5 persons from 10); nWays(form 2 teams of 4 and 6 from 10); nWays(form 2 teams of 5 each from 10); nWays(select 4 persons from 10)
- nPossibleUniqueHandshakes in a group of n people 
- nWays(Partition 2n people into n groups with 2 persons each); nWays(Partition 3n people into n groups with 3 persons each); Solve in 3 different ways. [Grouping problem]

- A certain family has 6 children, consisting of 3 boys and 3 girls. 
  Assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, what is the probability that the 3 eldest children are the 3 girls? (2 methods)
- Grouping problems: (3 methods where ever possible) 
  (a) How many ways are there to split a dozen people into 3 teams, where one team has 2 people, and the other two teams have 5 people each?
  (b) How many ways are there to split a dozen people into 3 teams, where each team has 4 people?
- A college has 10 (non-overlapping) time slots for its courses, and blithely assigns courses to time slots randomly and independently. A student randomly chooses 3 of the courses to enroll in (for the PTP, to avoid getting fined). 
  What is the probability that there is a conflict in the student’s schedule? [Birthday problem]
- A city with 6 districts has 6 robberies in a particular week. Assume the robberies are located randomly, with all possibilities for which robbery occurred where equally likely. 
  What is the probability that some district had more than 1 robbery? [Birthday problem]
- A fair die is rolled 6 times, P(some value is repeated)? [Birthday problem]
- Elk dwell in a certain forest. There are N elk, of which a simple random sample of size n are captured and tagged (“simple random sample” means that all NCn sets of n elk are equally likely). 
  The captured elk are returned to the population, and then a new sample is drawn, this time with size m. 
  This is an important method that is widely-used in ecology, known as capture-recapture.
  What is the probability that exactly k of the m elk in the new sample were previously tagged? 
  (Assume that an elk that was captured before doesn’t become more or less likely to be captured again.)
