✅ What

We’re asking:

Why does the probability of the second ball being green, before any ball is drawn, equal the probability that the first ball is green, even though the second draw seems dependent on the outcome of the first?

This feels non-intuitive because:
	•	We’re drawing without replacement, so the second ball does depend on the first.
	•	Our mind expects this dependency to change the probability.

Yet, surprisingly:
P(\text{2nd is green}) = \frac{g}{g + r} = P(\text{1st is green})

⸻

✅ Why – Where the Non-Intuition Comes From

🔸 (1) Our brain prefers cause-effect logic

We often think:
	•	“Once I remove a green, I have fewer greens left.”
	•	So the second draw should surely have a different probability.

🧠 But this is a conditional view: you’re assuming you already know the first draw.

Before the first draw, you don’t know which ball is removed — so on average, nothing has changed.

⸻

🔸 (2) We confuse information with effect

The act of drawing the first ball gives information about the second draw.

But this doesn’t mean the unconditional probability of the second draw is different. That is:
	•	After seeing the first ball, yes, the second ball’s probability changes.
	•	But if you haven’t seen the first ball, the probabilities are balanced by symmetry.

⸻

🔸 (3) Asymmetry in time, not in logic

In real life:
	•	First comes first → second depends on it.

But in probability:
	•	The labeling (first vs. second) is arbitrary in terms of probability — it doesn’t change the setup.

This is why thinking in terms of sets, not sequences, helps uncover the symmetry.

✅ How – Why It Actually Makes Sense

Let’s look again at the logic from the whole system view.

Imagine all possible pairs of balls you can draw. For every pair:
	•	One of the balls is first
	•	One is second

Now, consider:
	•	Out of all possible (first, second) pairs, how often is the second ball green?

Because every ball is equally likely to be in any position (before drawing), green balls are just as likely to appear second as first.

So:

\frac{\text{total green appearances in 2nd position}}{\text{total number of draws}} = \frac{g}{g + r}

⸻

✅ Summary

Intuition Gap	Explanation
Causal logic (“2nd depends on 1st”)	True only after drawing — conditional logic
We expect “knowledge” to affect all	But unconditional probability balances all possibilities
Feels asymmetric (first → second)	But the system is symmetric until you label outcomes
Outcome depends on ordering	But probabilities depend on distribution of all outcomes, not order

✅ Visual/Concrete Example (Optional)

Say r = 1, g = 1 → one red and one green.
	•	There are two equally likely draw sequences:
	1.	Green first, Red second
	2.	Red first, Green second

Each sequence has probability \frac{1}{2}
	•	First is green → 1 out of 2 → P(\text{1st green}) = \frac{1}{2}
	•	Second is green → appears in 1 out of 2 → P(\text{2nd green}) = \frac{1}{2}

✅ Perfect symmetry
